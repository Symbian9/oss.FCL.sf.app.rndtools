RELEASE NOTES - LAUNCHER v3.7.0
RELEASED 29th May 2009 

SUPPORTS S60 3.0+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================
Launcher is a testing utility application aimed to help test the launching of
applications installed in the system, both on user side disk drives and on
ROM. Launcher tests if an application can be launched and then, if the launch
has failed, reports the possible reason for the failure. It is a very useful
application when checking the build as the user can instantly see if the
applications work. Launcher can also be used when testing binary
compatibility issues because it can reveal any DLL files missing from the
device.

Main Features:
==============
- Show a list of installed applications in all drives
- Launch selected applications and read their statuses from threads
- In case of a failure, report thread's exit type, reason and category
- Show missing DLL files required by the binary to be launched
- Show problems on the UI and print all cases to a log file
- Generate a list of DLLs in the device to a file
- Analyse binary compatibility of system DLLs comparing them to a user
  given reference data. Report any binary compatibility issues or missing
  DLL files.

===============================================================================

What's New in v3.7.0
====================
- Feature: Binary compatiblity check for DLLs, which checks UID1, UID2, UID3, SID
and capability values of system DLLs against an XML-formatted input file.
- Fix: Launcher panics when comparing a large DLL list against system DLLs.
- Fix: Launcher panics when application launching is cancelled.

===============================================================================

Installation Notes:
===================
Launcher is typically preinstalled on ROM. If not, it can be added to the
ROM with the .iby file. Alternatively, a .sis file can be found under the sis-
directory, but the user needs to sign it with their own developer certificate.
In Nokia R&D environment, you can use directly the R&D-signed .sis file under the
internal\sis directory.

When signing with own developer certificate, the following capabilities are
needed:
  PowerMgmt
  ReadDeviceData
  WriteDeviceData
  AllFiles
  ReadUserData
  WriteUserData

When building Launcher against S60 3.0 or 3.1, you may need to patch your SDK
environment first with some fixes. For more information, please refer to the
instructions under the "envpatcher" directory.

Known Issues:
=============

Fails in a test despite the application is working correctly
------------------------------------------------------------
- Some application may exit immediately after a launch. This can be
  normal behavior and should be checked manually. Such application is, for example, 
  irapp.exe.
  
Binary compatibility check support
----------------------------------
- Currently, only uncompressed and deflate compressed ELF binaries are
  supported. This means that for example WINSCW is not supported.
