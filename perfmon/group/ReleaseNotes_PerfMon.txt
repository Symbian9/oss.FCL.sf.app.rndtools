Installation Notes:
===================
PerfMon is typically preinstalled on ROM. If not, it can be added to the
ROM with the .iby file. Alternatively, the .sis file can be found under the
sis-directory, but the user need to sign it with their own developer
certificate. In Nokia R&D environment, you can use directly the R&D-signed .sis
file under the internal\sis directory.

When signing with own developer certificate, the following capabilities are
needed:
  WriteDeviceData
  
When builing PerfMon against S60 3.0 or 3.1, you may need to patch your SDK
environment first with some fixes. For more information, please refer to the
instructions under the "envpatcher" directory.
